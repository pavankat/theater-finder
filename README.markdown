This was my first try at working with a XML based API. 

The code is live here: http://venturelateral.com/theater_finder/theater-finder.php. 
It doesn't work now, because the API was shut down. 

It's a theater finder. It locates the nearest theaters near you.

I used the hollywoodmoviemoney.com's XML API.
